  * Every sub-folder contains all test suites generated for specific a specific FM family. Each file is named as \[Original_Model_Name\]\_\[Evolved_Model_Name\]\_\[RandomNumber\]\_\[Policy\]\_\[RepetitionNumber\]. For each test execution, two files are generated: one (.txt) contains the test suite, and one (.time) contains the time required for its generation.
